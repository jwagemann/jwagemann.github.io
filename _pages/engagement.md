Women in Geospatial network
------
I initiated the [Women in Geospatial+ network](https://womeningeospatial.org), a professional network for women+ to promote gender-equality in the geospatial industry and academia. The network provides its members opportunities to network and suppport each other, via a mailing list and Slack channel. Activities include a [global mentorship program](https://www.womeningeospatial.org/join/mentorship), a [speakers database](https://speakers.womeningeospatial.org/speakers) of women+ in the geospatial domain and a [webinar series on career development](https://www.womeningeospatial.org/events/webinar-series). If you are interested to join, you can fill in this [form](https://bit.ly/womeningeospatial_signup) or [reach out](mailto:womeningeospatial@gmail.com) to us, if you would like to discuss something else.


NGO Glocal LifeLearn e.V.
------
I am a co-founder and currently the 1st board member of the German-based NGO [Glocal LifeLearn e.V.](https://www.glocal-lifelearn.org). We are supporting education initiatives worldwide, aiming to give disadvantaged children access to education. In the last ten years, we established an educational sponsorship program together with the Bukedea Lifeline Schools in East Uganda. We currently give 62 disadvantaged children the opportunity to receive a good education by paying their school fees and school uniform.<br>
In 2019, we received a grant of 25.000 Euro from the Germany Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development in order to establish a training centre for nurses and midwifes in Bukedea, together with the Bukedea Lifeline Schools.
