Hi, I am Julia and I am a <font color='#2aa198'>independent consultant, PhD candidate and community builder</font> on a mission to make open meteorological, climate and atmospheric data better accessible. My work is in the intersection between data users and data providers. I am a strong believer in the leverage of open-source geospatial software and in bringing different Earth Science communities together in order to make the best use of open geospatial data.<br>
You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JuliaWagemann), [GitHub](https://github.com/jwagemann) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-wagemann/).

- Independent consultant - Geospatial data and systems
------
I do consultancy work on open geospatial data and systems as well as user engagement. I run [workshops](/talks), mainly on interactive (geo-)spatial data analysis, with Jupyter notebooks, Python and R.<br>
Projects I have been working on recently:<br>
  - *Program lead* - [ECMWF Summer of Weather Code (ESoWC)](https://esowc.ecmwf.int) programme, an online coding programme to develop weather-related open-source software.<br>
  - *Main developer and content lead* - [**Learning Tool for Python (LTPy) on Atmospheric Composition Data**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/gitlab.eumetsat.int/eumetlab/atmosphere/atmosphere/-/raw/master/00_index_ltpy.ipynb), a series of Jupyter notebooks for atmospheric composition data, including Sentinel-5p, Sentinel-3, GOME-2, IASI and CAMS. *(in collaboration with <a href="https://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/index.html" target="_blank">EUMETSAT</a> and <a href="http://www.meeo.it/wp/" target="_blank">MEEO s.r.l.</a>)*<br>
  - *Developer* - [**Development of practical tutorials and How-To Guides**](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/toolbox/doc/index.html) for <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/" target="_blank">Copernicus Climate Data Store Toolbox</a>. *(in collaboration with <a href="http://www.bopen.it/" target="_blank">B-Open Solutions</a>, <a href="http://sabrinaszeto.com/" target="_blank">Sabrina Szeto Consulting</a> and EJR-Quartz)*<br>
  - *Main developer and project lead* - [ERA5 in Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/jwagemann/era5_in_gee), to make a subset of the Copernicus climate reanalysis [ERA5 dataset](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) available as part of <a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_DAILY" target="__blank">Google Earth Engine's public data catalog</a>.

- PhD research
------
I pursue a [PhD at the Faculty of Geography at University of Marburg](http://vhrz669.hrz.uni-marburg.de/lcrs/content_subprojects.do?phase=1&subpage=aims&subprojectid=1013), in collaboration with ECMWF. My research is in the interface of open climate and meteorological data, user requirements, Big data technologies and cloud computing. I am interested how big data technologies, such as Apache Spark or Dask, can be leveraged in order to provide efficient geospatial data services on the cloud.
