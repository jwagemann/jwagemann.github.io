Hi, I am Julia and I am an <font color='#2aa198'>independent consultant, PhD candidate and community builder</font> on a mission to make open meteorological, climate and atmospheric data better accessible and used. 


For the past six years, my work has been in the intersection between data providers and users, resulting in a strong ability to translate user needs into a compelling vision for user support and training services. I am a strong believer in open-source geospatial software and in bringing different Earth Science communities together in order to make the best use of open geospatial data.<br>


You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JuliaWagemann), [GitHub](https://github.com/jwagemann) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-wagemann/).

- Independent consultant - Geospatial data and systems
------
I do consultancy work on open geospatial data and systems as well as user engagement. I run [workshops](/talks), mainly on interactive (geo-)spatial data analysis, with Jupyter notebooks, Python and R.<br>
Projects I have been working on recently:<br>
  - Development of educational Jupyter notebook modules on Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation and Copernicus as part of the upcoming AI4EO MOOC by EUMETSAT/ECMWF/Mercator Ocean.
  - [**ECMWF Summer of Weather Code (ESoWC)**](https://esowc.ecmwf.int) programme, an online coding programme to develop weather-related open-source software.<br>
  - [**Learning Tool for Python (LTPy) on Atmospheric Composition Data**](https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/eumetlab/atmosphere/atmosphere), a series of Jupyter notebooks for atmospheric composition data. *(in collaboration with <a href="https://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/index.html" target="_blank">EUMETSAT</a> and <a href="http://www.meeo.it/wp/" target="_blank">MEEO s.r.l.</a>)*<br>
  - [**Development of practical tutorials and How-To Guides**](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/toolbox/doc/index.html) for <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/" target="_blank">Copernicus Climate Data Store Toolbox</a>. *(in collaboration with <a href="http://www.bopen.it/" target="_blank">B-Open Solutions</a>, <a href="http://sabrinaszeto.com/" target="_blank">Sabrina Szeto Consulting</a> and EJR-Quartz)*<br>
  - [**ERA5 in Google Earth Engine**](https://github.com/jwagemann/era5_in_gee), to make a subset of the Copernicus climate reanalysis [ERA5 dataset](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) available as part of <a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_DAILY" target="__blank">Google Earth Engine's public data catalog</a>.

- PhD research
------
I pursue a [PhD at the Faculty of Geography at University of Marburg](http://vhrz669.hrz.uni-marburg.de/lcrs/content_subprojects.do?phase=1&subpage=aims&subprojectid=1013) on 'Cloud-based services for Big Earth Data: user requirements, categorisation and interoperability needs'.

- Leadership and Community builder
------
  - Selected as one of 100 participants worldwide for [Homeward Bound](https://homewardboundprojects.com.au/hb6/hb6-2021-participants/), a year-long online leadership program for women in STEMM
